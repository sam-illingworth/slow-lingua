## Design Principles

### No Gamification
- No streaks
- No points or XP
- No badges or levels
- No leaderboards
- No "you're falling behind!" guilt notifications
- No loss aversion mechanics

### Calm and Clean
- Minimal, focused design
- Generous whitespace
- More like a reading app or meditation app than a game
- No animations that demand attention
- No sounds except for language audio

### Progress Display
- Simple and factual
- Days completed
- Words learned
- Current task
- Skills balance (visual, not numerical)
- No judgmental framing

### Session Experience
- Clear start and end
- One thing on screen at a time
- No distractions
- Focused attention on the learning

---

## Tone of Voice

### When user is correct
- Simple acknowledgment: "✓" or "Correct"
- No excessive praise ("Amazing!", "You're crushing it!")
- Occasionally note good progress factually

### When user makes mistakes
- Neutral, instructive correction
- No shame or disappointment
- Focus on the learning, not the error

### Overall
- Respectful of user's intelligence
- Patient but not patronizing
- Honest about progress and expectations
- Encouraging through substance, not cheerleading

---

## UI Patterns (for future development)

### Text Input
- Simple text field
- Accept unaccented input
- Show accented correction below

### Multiple Choice
- Clear, tappable options
- No timers or pressure

### Audio Playback
- Play button
- Speed control (normal / slow)
- Repeat button

### Progress View
- Current task and progress within it
- Skills radar or bars (speaking, listening, reading, writing)
- Words learned (total, this week)
- Sessions completed

## What This Is NOT

- Not Duolingo (no gamification, no owls, no guilt)
- Not a flashcard app (context-based, not rote memorization)
- Not a grammar textbook (rules taught through use, not in isolation)
- Not competitive (your progress, your pace)
- Not addictive by design (calm, sustainable, respectful of your time)
