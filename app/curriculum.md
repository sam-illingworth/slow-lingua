# Task-Based Curriculum

Progression is task-based, not grammar-based. Each task teaches language through a real situation.

Tasks unlock adaptively - when you've mastered prerequisites, next tasks become available.

## How Tasks Work

Each task includes:
1. **Phrases** - Core language to learn
2. **Vocabulary** - Words needed for this task
3. **Grammar** - Rules that emerge naturally (taught when encountered)
4. **Exercises** - Speaking, listening, reading, writing activities
5. **Conversation** - Practice using the task in dialogue
6. **Check** - Can you do this task in real life?

Tasks are not "completed" linearly - you return to them for review and deepening.

## Skill Weighting Within Tasks

Each task should cover all four skills:
- Speaking: 30%
- Listening: 25%
- Reading: 25%
- Writing: 20%

Adjust based on user's skill balance (more practice on weaker skills).
