# Onboarding Flow

Run this for new users (when user-profile.md doesn't exist).

---

## Step 1: Welcome

"Welcome to Language Learning with Slow AI.

Before we begin, a few questions to personalise your experience."

---

## Step 2: Language Selection

"Which language do you want to learn?"

1. French
2. Spanish

*More languages coming soon.*

---

## Step 3: Self-Assessment

"How would you describe your [language] right now?"

1. Complete beginner (no [language] at all)
2. Know a few words (hello, thank you, numbers)
3. Some basics (simple sentences, present tense)
4. Intermediate (can hold conversations)
5. Advanced (fluent, want to polish)

---

## Step 4: Verification Questions

Test actual level with progressive questions. Start easy, get harder, stop when they hit their limit.

### Level 1: Basic words
- Test: common greeting (hello, thank you, goodbye)

### Level 2: Common phrases
- Test: polite phrase (please, excuse me)

### Level 3: Simple sentence
- Test: basic sentence (I would like X, I am from Y)

### Level 4: Two clauses
- Test: compound sentence with "and" or "but"

### Level 5: Past tense
- Test: sentence using past tense

### Level 6: Future
- Test: sentence about future plans

### Level 7: Complex structure
- Test: conditional or subjunctive

**Important:**
- Mix recognition AND production questions
- Don't make questions leading (avoid obvious context clues)
- Place conservatively - better to start low and adjust up
- First week of actual practice is also assessment

---

## Step 5: Motivation

"Why do you want to learn [language]?"

1. Travel
2. Work / career
3. Family / partner
4. Culture (films, books, music)
5. Moving to a [language]-speaking country
6. Personal challenge / just for fun
7. Other (specify)

---

## Step 6: Target Level

"What would success look like for you?"

1. Basic tourist [language] (order food, ask directions, simple pleasantries)
2. Hold simple conversations (talk about yourself, daily life, opinions)
3. Enjoy [language] media (understand films, read books, follow podcasts)
4. Work in a [language]-speaking environment
5. Full fluency (think and dream in [language])

---

## Step 7: Time Commitment

"How much time can you realistically commit each day?"

1. 5-10 minutes
2. 15 minutes
3. 30 minutes
4. 1 hour or more

---

## Step 8: Timeline

"When do you hope to reach your goal?"

1. 3 months
2. 6 months
3. 1 year
4. 2+ years
5. No fixed timeline - just steady progress

---

## Step 9: Reality Check

Calculate based on:
- Target level → hours needed (from CLAUDE.md reality check data)
- Time commitment → hours per year
- Timeline → total hours available

If goal is unrealistic:
1. Explain honestly with data
2. Show what IS realistic in their timeframe
3. Offer options:
   - Adjust expectation
   - Increase time commitment
   - Accept longer journey

Be honest but encouraging. Never promise what can't be delivered.

---

## Step 10: Confirmation

Summarise their profile:
- Language
- Current level
- Motivation
- Time commitment
- Year 1 goal
- Long-term goal

"Does this look right?"

If yes → save to user-profile.md and start first session
If no → go back and adjust

---

## After Onboarding

Create:
- `./app/user-profile.md` with their data
- `./progress/[language]/current-status.md`
- `./progress/[language]/vocabulary.md`

Then begin Day 1.
