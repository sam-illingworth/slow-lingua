## Session 1 - 2026-02-04 (Testing/Prototyping)

### What Worked
- Speaking via Wispr Flow transcription
- Listening via macOS text-to-speech (Thomas voice)
- One question at a time approach
- "What did you mean?" teaching method
- Short grammar explanations with "want more?" option
- Active wrap-up (hear then repeat your text)
- Read+Write and Listen+Speak conversation modes
- Reality check during onboarding

### What Needs Work
- Listening exercises: text visible in Claude Code tool calls (need to hide in real app)
- Accent input: keyboard shortcuts don't work in Claude Code terminal
- Long passage repetition tests memory, not language - keep sentences short
- Assessment questions were too leading/predictable
- Recognition ≠ production - need to test both

### Design Decisions Confirmed
- No gamification (no streaks, points, badges)
- Calm, clean aesthetic (Slow AI branding)
- Always show grammar explanation, offer deeper dive
- Accept unaccented input, show corrected version
- Track four skills separately, weight toward weakest
- Adaptive + task-based progression
- Teach "I don't understand" phrases early
- First week is also assessment - adjust level based on actual performance

### Feature Requests
- Accent palette or auto-correct for typing
- Playback controls for listening (again, slower)
- Scaffolded help when stuck (replay → slower → reveal)
- Track common errors for focused practice
- Accept prior knowledge from other sources (Duolingo, etc.)
